I often created android app which can be used offline before. However, I am recently interested in API and learning how to get connection status, images and so on.

My newest app is "Bit", which can get posts in Instagram and open album (please images for details!). The app uses "Instagram Graph API". Instagram has a function called "album posting", which allows you to combine multiple photos into one post. However, the viewer has to scroll over and over, which is troublesome. Therefore, I created an application that displays a list of posts with an expand button by searching for a user name.

## :blue_book: What Validated Numerics is
Floating-point in C (hereinafter, this is called f) can preserve 16 digits. If my computer calculate "1/3", f preserve not "1/3", but "0.3333....". Therefore, computer can not save value perfectly and small errors can be large error.

Simple example is shown below. If I want to calculate the formula
$$x=\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\}{2a}\ (a=1, b= 10^{15}, c = 10^{14})$$
This is a well-known formula and most students would have used it.

Its true answer is $x = -0.1$. However, standard computers indicate the answer is $x = -0.125$.
The cause is that a is almost omitted because b and c is too large. In this case, the solution is to rationalize the molecule. By using below formula,
$$x=\frac{2c}{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\}\$$
computers indicate $x = -1.0000000000000002$. we can calculate accurately by devising.

## :grey_question: Why I learn Validated Numerics
In android app, we will have the opportunity to sort something. 

For example, I want to add the function which can sort something in the order of users interest. If there is a criterion, I only use MySQL. However, if I want to sort by comparing multiple criteria, I need to create the function by myself. At that time, it is a problem if the results are significantly different because of errors and errors may be abused if users notice them. 

Numeric calculations are essential for many algorithms and I think Validated Numerics is useful for many algorithms.
